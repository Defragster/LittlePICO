YAPE: Yet Another PICO ESP32

First rev of a PICO D4 PCB - using board type of Pico Dev Kit : pico32.name=ESP32 Pico Kit

But adds PSRAM: To add PSRAM enable, use boards.local.txt in the hardware\esp32\1.0.6 folder

Otherwise just a pile of test of function sketches. Compared to very similar TinyPICO with PSRAM.
